With the economy being jump started by true patriots who received the vaccine and the booster, coupled with a spirit of adventure and a touch of cabin fever, folks are beginning to travel more frequently both for business and pleasure. The positioning of the planet on it's axis and it's ecliptic as it traverses the main celestial body in our solar system dictates that special attention is paid to weather; particularly this time of year!

To provide for all contingencies in packing for upcoming travels, a dashboard has been created to remove any uncertainty with regards to necessary accoutrements to bring along.

```bash
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city
and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation
of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed,
and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions
are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon
representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the
humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
